In this stage, we will discuss how files are created and deleted by the application program with the help of file system calls Create and Delete. Shutdown system call will be modified in this stage.

Create system call creates an empty file with the name given as input. Create system call initializes the disk data structures with meta data related to the file. Inode table and root file are the disk data structures used to maintain permanent record of files. Delete system call deletes the record of the file with the given name from inode table and root file. Delete also releases the disk blocks occupied by the file to be deleted. The Shutdown system call is modified to commit the changes made by Create and Delete system calls in the memory copy of the disk data structures back into the disk.
