If the XSM simulator is run with the the timer set to some value - say 20, then every time the machine completes execution of 20 instructions in user mode, the timer device will send a hardware signal that interrupts machine execution. 
The machine will push the IP value of the next user mode instruction to the stack and pass control to the the timer interrupt handler at physical address 2048.
eXpOS design given here requires you to load a timer interrupt routine into two pages of memory starting at memory address 2048 (pages 4 and 5). 
The routine must be written by you and loaded into disk blocks 17 and 18 so that the OS startup code can load this code into memory pages 4 and 5.
In this stage, we will run the machine with timer on and write a simple timer interrupt handler.
