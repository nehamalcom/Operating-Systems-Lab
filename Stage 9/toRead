eXpOS requires that when the OS enters an interrupt handler that runs in kernel mode, the interrupt handler must switch to a different stack. 
This requirement is to prevent user level “hacks” into the kernel through the stack. 
In the previous stage, though you entered the timer interrupt service routine in the kernel mode, you did not change the stack. 
In this stage, this will be done.
