In this stage, we will introduce disk interrupt handling in XSM. 
In the previous stage, we used the loadi statement to load a disk block into a memory page. 
When the loadi statement (immediate load) is used for loading, the machine will execute the next instruction only after the block transfer is complete by the disk controller. 
A process can use the load statement instead of loadi to load a disk block to a memory page. 
The load statement in SPL translates to LOAD instruction in XSM.
