This stage introduces you to multi-programming. You will load two processes into memory during OS bootstrap and put them on concurrent execution. 
For this, you need to modify the timer interrupt handler to switch between the two processes.
We will use the the same init process as in stage 11. A second process called an idle process will also be set up in memory for execution during OS startup. 
The idle process simply contains an infinite loop.
You will modify the timer to implement a very primitive scheduler which shares the machine between the two processes.
