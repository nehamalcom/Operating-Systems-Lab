In Stage 7, we wrote a user program and used the BRKP instruction to view the result in debug mode. 
In this stage, we will modify the program such that the result is printed directly to the terminal. 
The terminal print is acheived by issuing a write system call from the user program. 
The write system call is serviced by interrupt routine 7.
