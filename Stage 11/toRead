ExpL is a high level language in which you can write high level application programs. 
A compiler for ExpL supplied to you along with the eXpOS package will generate target code compatible with the eXpOS specification. 
ExpL permits application programs to call the function exposcall() that implements the high level library interface to the OS. 
Application programs must use this library interface to invoke eXpOS system calls. 
Certain built-in functions of the ExpL language (Alloc, Free and Initialize - these functions handle ExpL dynamic memory management) are also implemented as ExpL library routines. 
Note that the only way to invoke an eXpOS system call from a high level ExpL program is to use the exposcall() function.
