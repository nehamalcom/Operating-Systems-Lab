Exec is the "program loader" of eXpOS. 
Exec takes as input a filename. It first checks whether the file is a valid eXpOS executable stored in the XSM disk, adhering to the XEXE format. 
If so, Exec destroys the invoking process, loads the executable file from the disk, and sets up the program for execution as a process. 
A successful exec operation results in the termination of the invoking process and hence never returns to it.
Name of the executable file is the only input to the exec system call. 
This file should be present in the disk before starting the machine. 
The inode index of this file can be obtained by going through the memory copy of the inode table.
